# Text-Converter
In this project, we have some raw test files, and we want to analyze syntax of these files and somehow show their data and also extract them.
</br> The project consists of 4 main parts:

- ***Refining data:***
</br> In the first part, we do some preprocess on the files, and prepare it for data extraction.

- ***Extracting data:***
</br> In the second part, we try to extract data of files and save them in an object-oriented structure in memory.

- ***Exporting data:***
</br> In the third part, we use data extracted from extraction part and export them into excel format, for better visualizing and analysis of data.

- ***Converting data:***
</br> In the last part, after we finished our analysis of data, we convert the data files into another format of test files.
